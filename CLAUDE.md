# AI Instructions

You must read `CODEBASE_RULES.md` for full workflow. Key points for AI:

- **Section 1 (HUMAN EDITS ONLY):** Do not edit without explicit human approval
- **Section 2 (HUMAN + AI):** Can collaborate freely
- If docs and code conflict, ask — don't assume
- Log your changes: `YYYY-MM-DD :: [author] :: [summary]` (author refers to the user reponsable for the AI)
